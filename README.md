# NLPUsingMarkovModels

This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects implemented while following the Udemy course [Data Science: Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-natural-language-processing-in-python/) by [Lazy Programmer Inc.](https://lazyprogrammer.me) Each project is designed to reinforce the theoretical concepts and practical applications of Markov chains in text generation and analysis.

## üìö Course Overview

The projects in this repository are based on the above mentioned Udemy course that covers:

- Fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Character-level language models using the Markov principle
- Cipher decryption algorithms with applications in warfare and espionage
- Genetic algorithms for text analysis
- Building practical NLP systems with Python


## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NLTK / spaCy (for tokenization and text preprocessing)
- NumPy / pandas (for matrix and data manipulation)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations, if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for exploratory analysis)

## üß† What I Learnt

- How to model language using probabilistic models
- Constructing and using transition matrices
- Implementing Markov-based text generators
- Evaluating generated text for coherence and variety
- Applying genetic algorithms for text analysis
- Building cipher decryption algorithms, spam detector, sentiment analysis tool and an article spinner

## Project Descriptions

- CipherDecrypter : This code decrypts a simple substitution cipher using probabilities learned from English text (like Moby Dick). It creates a random cipher (letter substitution), learns letter and word probabilities from real text, scores how likely a decoded message is, tries to guess the original message using these scores.
  
- PoetryGenerator : This notebook trains a Markov chain-based text generator using poetry by Robert Frost. It builds probability dictionaries from word sequences (first- and second-order Markov models). Then, it uses these probabilities to generate new poetry that mimics Frost‚Äôs style.
  
- BasicSentimentAnalyser : The notebook builds a basic sentiment analysis model using the NLTK movie reviews dataset. It extracts features from text (like word presence), trains a Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluates accuracy. The model then predicts whether new sentences express positive or negative sentiment. It uses supervised learning with simple bag-of-words features.

- LatentSemanticAnalyser : The notebook performs Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) using TF-IDF vectorization followed by Truncated SVD for dimensionality reduction.
It tells us about the hidden relationships between terms and documents by projecting them into a latent semantic space. This helps capture synonymy and contextual meaning beyond surface-level word matching.

- ArticleSpinner : Its my own take at an article spinner that takes reviews as input and with the help of various markov models tries to spin the review in its own terms
