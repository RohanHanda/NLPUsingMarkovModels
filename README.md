# NLPUsingMarkovModels

This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects implemented while following the Udemy course [Data Science: Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-natural-language-processing-in-python/) by [Lazy Programmer Inc.](https://lazyprogrammer.me) Each project is designed to reinforce the theoretical concepts and practical applications of Markov chains in text generation and analysis.

## 📚 Course Overview

The projects in this repository are based on the above mentioned Udemy course that covers:

- Fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Character-level language models using the Markov principle
- Cipher decryption algorithms with applications in warfare and espionage
- Genetic algorithms for text analysis
- Building practical NLP systems with Python


## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NLTK / spaCy (for tokenization and text preprocessing)
- NumPy / pandas (for matrix and data manipulation)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations, if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for exploratory analysis)

## 🧠 What I Learnt

- How to model language using probabilistic models
- Constructing and using transition matrices
- Implementing Markov-based text generators
- Evaluating generated text for coherence and variety
- Applying genetic algorithms for text analysis
- Building cipher decryption algorithms, spam detector, sentiment analysis tool and an article spinner
  

## ✅ Status

- ✔️ Projects completed as per course
- 🔄 May include future enhancements or experiments

## 📌 Note

These projects are meant for educational purposes and are directly inspired by the exercises and assignments from the Udemy course.
